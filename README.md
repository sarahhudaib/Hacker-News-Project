# Hacker-News-Project: What is this project?

As a programmer, I want to stay up to date on new technologies, so I read articles on the 'Hacker News' website, particularly those that have been voted on more than 100 times by the community, but sometimes I'm too busy to search for high rated articles, so I formed this program to help me find the top high rated articles from the first two pages of the site.

# Technologies
- Python 3.9.5
- beautifulsoup4
- requests

# Launch
Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.

- pip install beautifulsoup4

Requests allows us to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily.
- pip install requests

# Setup
